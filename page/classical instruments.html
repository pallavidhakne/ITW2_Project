    <p id="piano">This is an string instrument, which has felt hammers that strikes the string to produce the pleasant sound. The piano is often seen in chamber music, solo performance, ensemble use and accompaniment. Though massive in size and highly expensive, the piano has found its place in most setting due to its ubiquity and versatility.</p>

    <div id="clarinet"><p id="clarinettxt">The clarinet is a woodwind instrument.
        The clarinet body is made up of the mouthpiece, barrel, upper joint, pads, keys, ring key, rod, lower joint, and bell. The clarinet has one reed. The reed is made of cane, bamboo or plastic, which varies in thickness. The reed is attached to the mouthpiece with a clamp called a ligature, which is usually made out of metal. Blowing through the mouthpiece makes the reed vibrate, and therefore makes the noise.</p>

    <p id="double_bass">The double bass, also known as the standup bass, is the largest and lowest pitched bowed string instrument used in the modern symphony orchestra. It is used extensively in Western classical music as a standard member of the string section of symphony orchestras and smaller string ensembles. In addition, it is used in other genres such as jazz, blues, rock and roll, psychobilly, rockabilly, and bluegrass. As with many other string instruments, the double bass is played with a bow(arco) or by plucking the strings (pizzicato).</p>
    <div id="trumpet">
        <p id="trumpettxt">The trumpet is a brass instrument commonly used in classical and jazz ensembles. The trumpet group ranges from the piccolo trumpet with the highest register in the brass family, to the bass trumpet, which is pitched one octave below the standard B♭ or C Trumpet.They are played by blowing air through nearly-closed lips (called the player's embouchure), producing a "buzzing" sound that starts a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the instrument.</p>

    <img height="350px" width="450px" src="/image/flute.jpg" >
    <p id="flute">The flute is a family of musical instruments in the woodwind group. Unlike woodwind instruments with reeds, a flute is an aerophone or reedless wind instrument that produces its sound from the flow of air across an opening. According to the instrument classification of Hornbostel–Sachs, flutes are categorized as edge-blown aerophones.A musician who plays the flute is called a flautist or flutist.</p>
    <img src="/image/harp.jpg" id="harpimg">
    <div id="harp"><p id="harptxt">The 
        harp is a stringed instrument in which the resonator, or belly, is perpendicular, or nearly so, to the plane of the strings. Each string produces one note, the gradation of string length from short to long corresponding to that from high to low pitch. The resonator is usually of wood or skin. In arched, or bow-shaped, harps the neck extends from and forms a curve with the body. In angular harps, body and neck form an angle. In frame harps (mostly confined to Europe), body and neck are set at an angle and are connected by a column, pillar, or forepillar, that braces against the tension of the strings.
